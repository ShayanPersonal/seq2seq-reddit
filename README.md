# seq2seq-reddit

Seq2seq implemented in Tensorflow in an attempt to create a Reddit bot to pass the "turing test" on the "totallynotrobots" subreddit. 
Includes helper methods for scraping Reddit posts with the PRAW API.

Converges to outputting variations of "I IS HUMAN" and "HAHA" after some time.

Used ematvey's tutorial for implementing seq2seq in Tensorflow:
